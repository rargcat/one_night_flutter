## Running

1. Configure an API project with the Google Maps Platform and acquire the API keys for both iOS and Android.

- To add an API key to the Android app, edit the AndroidManifest.xml file in android/app/src/main.
- To add an API key to the iOS app, edit the AppDelegate.m file in ios/Runner.

2. Run the application on your device using "flutter run".
